Display tags for the current post in a widget.

== Description ==
Have you ever needed to display the tags for the current post somewhere other than below the post, as is standard in many themes? Now, with Post Tags Widget, you can place them anywhere you have a widget area! And it will only display when viewing a single post that actually has tags!
